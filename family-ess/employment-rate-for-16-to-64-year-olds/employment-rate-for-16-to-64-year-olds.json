    "summary": "Proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years in paid work or who had a job that they were temporarily away from, Great Britain (Northern Ireland national figure included), 01/2004-12/2004 to 01/2022-12/2022.",
    "description": "This dataset shows the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years in paid work or who had a job that they were temporarily away from, in Great Britain (Northern Ireland national figure included), for 01/2004-12/2004 to 01/2022-12/2022.\n\n### Coverage \n\nGB (England, Wales and Scotland). Northern Ireland national figure included.\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,\nMetropolitan Counties,\nRegions,\nCombined Authorities,\nNations (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland),\nCountries (UK, GB, England and Wales)\n\n### Source\n\n - Great Britain: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/regionallabourmarket/previousReleases) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \nThis indicator is based on re-weighted Annual Population Survey datasets updated on 16 August 2022. For more information, see [Impact of reweighting on Labour Force Survey key indicators: 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/impactofreweightingonlabourforcesurveykeyindicators/2022) \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
