# Creating a GLM using the Inspect API

The notebook will go through the process of creating a Generalised Linear Model using the Inspect API. It will show the power of linked data where data from different domains (economics, demography and education) will be merged together using linked data.

This work was presented at the Royal Statistical Society Conference.
