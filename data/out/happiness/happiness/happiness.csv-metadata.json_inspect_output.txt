		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		On 31 October 2022, alongside the publication of the latest personal well-being estimates for the period between April 2021 to March 2022, previously published estimates for the periods between April 2011 and March 2019 have been updated due to changes in guidance on data suppression, where estimates are no longer required to be suppressed solely based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values. Previously published estimates were suppressed based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values being over 20. Estimates have also been updated following quality assurance of previous publications.
